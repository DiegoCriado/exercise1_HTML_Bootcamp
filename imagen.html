    <h1>Music for all</h1>

    <h2>The Beatles</h2>

        <p><b>The Beatles</b> were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. 
        With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, 
        they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rockera. 
        In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", 
        which is a term that describe the intense fan frenzy directed toward the British band. 
        The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the band's breakup in 1970.</p>

            On Feb. 7, 1964, the Beatles arrived at newly named John F. Kennedy airport in Queens, N.Y. to a 
            surprisingly shocking mob of screaming fans and reporters. With their mop-top hair, British humor
            and catchy music â€” John, Paul, George and Ringo were something new and fresh that Americans hadn't 
            seen or heard before.

                <p>
                    "Zambezi" is performed by Tinashe on solo Alto kalimba and voice, and we also have a link to him performing
                    it with a four-piece band. There is not much information available about him to be found on the Internet. 
                    But be aware that there is another Tinashe - a female African American artist, who is more famous than the Tinashe
                    of "Zambezi" fame; she doesn't play the kalimba - so try not to confuse the two.
